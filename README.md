# rname
## Features
**Allows the user to change the name of files**
* Constricts the user to using a whitelist of character for naming the new file
* Validates that the file that they wish to change exists
* Validates that there are no files in the directory that are the same as the new name
## In the future
* I would like to flesh out the Make file for testing and building purposes
